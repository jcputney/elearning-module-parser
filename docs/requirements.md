# eLearning Module Parser Requirements

## Project Overview

The eLearning Module Parser is a robust, modular library designed to parse and validate eLearning
module manifests in industry-standard formats. It aims to help developers integrate eLearning
content into Learning Management Systems (LMS) and other platforms by providing a standardized way
to extract metadata and validate the structure of eLearning modules.

## Supported eLearning Standards

The library must support parsing and validation of the following eLearning standards:

1. **SCORM 1.2** - Shareable Content Object Reference Model version 1.2
2. **SCORM 2004** - Shareable Content Object Reference Model version 2004 (all editions)
3. **AICC** - Aviation Industry Computer-Based Training Committee
4. **cmi5** - Computer Managed Instruction standard (Experience API Profile)

## Functional Requirements

### Core Functionality

1. **Module Type Detection**

- The system must automatically detect the type of eLearning module (SCORM 1.2, SCORM 2004, AICC,
    cmi5)
- Detection should be based on the presence and structure of standard manifest files

2. **Manifest Parsing**

- Parse manifest files for each supported standard:
  - SCORM 1.2: imsmanifest.xml
  - SCORM 2004: imsmanifest.xml with appropriate namespaces
  - AICC: course.au, descriptor files (.crs, .des, .cst)
  - cmi5: cmi5.xml

3. **Metadata Extraction**

- Extract standardized metadata from modules, including:
  - Title
  - Description
  - Identifier
  - Version
  - Launch URL
  - Prerequisites
  - Objectives
  - Duration
  - Mastery score

4. **Resource Validation**

- Verify that all referenced resources (files) exist within the module
- Report missing or invalid resources

5. **Structure Parsing**

- Parse the organizational structure of modules (items, activities, etc.)
- Extract sequencing information where applicable (SCORM 2004)
- Support hierarchical content structures

6. **External Metadata Support**

- Load and parse external metadata files referenced in the manifest
- Support for IEEE LOM (Learning Object Metadata) format

7. **xAPI Detection**

- Detect if a module includes xAPI (Experience API) support
- Identify xAPI-related files (xAPI.js, sendStatement.js)

### File Access

1. **Multiple Storage Mechanisms**

- Support for accessing module files from:
  - Local file system
  - ZIP archives
  - AWS S3 (both SDK v1 and v2)
  - Extensible to support other storage mechanisms

2. **File Operations**

- Check if files exist
- List files in directories
- Read file contents as streams

## Technical Requirements

### Architecture

1. **Modular Design**

- Clear separation of concerns between:
  - Module type detection
  - File access
  - Manifest parsing
  - Metadata extraction

2. **Extensibility**

- Support for adding new module types
- Support for adding new file access mechanisms
- Support for custom metadata processing

3. **Interface-Based Design**

- Well-defined interfaces for key components
- Dependency injection for implementation flexibility

### Performance

1. **Memory Efficiency**

- Streaming-based parsing for large files
- Minimal memory footprint

2. **Error Handling**

- Robust error handling with meaningful error messages
- Graceful degradation when non-critical parts of a module are invalid

### Compatibility

1. **Java Version**

- Compatible with Java 17 or higher

2. **Dependencies**

- Minimal external dependencies
- Optional dependencies for specific features (e.g., AWS S3 support)

## Constraints and Limitations

1. **Standards Compliance**

- Must strictly adhere to the specifications of each supported eLearning standard
- Must handle variations and edge cases in how standards are implemented by different authoring
    tools

2. **Backward Compatibility**

- Must maintain backward compatibility with previous versions of the library
- API changes should be clearly documented and versioned

3. **Performance Considerations**

- Must be efficient enough to handle large modules with many resources
- Should minimize file system or network operations

## Dependencies

### Required Dependencies

1. **Java 17+** - Core language requirement
2. **Jackson XML** - For XML parsing and processing
3. **Apache Commons Lang** - For utility functions

### Optional Dependencies

1. **AWS SDK v1** - For S3 file access using SDK v1
2. **AWS SDK v2** - For S3 file access using SDK v2

## Testing Requirements

1. **Unit Tests**

- Comprehensive test coverage for all parsers and components
- Tests for edge cases and error conditions

2. **Integration Tests**

- End-to-end tests with sample modules of each supported type
- Tests for different file access mechanisms

3. **Test Resources**

- Sample modules for each supported standard
- Test fixtures for various scenarios and edge cases
